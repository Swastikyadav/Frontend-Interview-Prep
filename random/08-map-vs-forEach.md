Explain the difference between map and forEach.

Answer:
Map and forEach both are methods of Array object, used to iterate over arrays.
The main difference between them are:

- map returns a new array, forEach does not return anything (or we can say returns undefined).
- We can chain Array methods after map as it returns a new array. But we cann't chain Array methods after forEach as it returns undefined.
